# Smart_Contract

This repository is in the making. I am currently working on developing my first certified smart-contract. It uses both solidity and python languages.

Smart contracts are the basis of trading crypto-currency on the ethereum network. You may think that trading/ investing in crypto is the only application of this. Far from it. In fact I'm not really interested in the volatility of investing in crypto. But smart-contracts are potentially a game-changer for many things including employment contracts in labor industries and poor releif/ charity/ welfare sectors.
